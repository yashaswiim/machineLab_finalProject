## Falconry in the UAE

### Idea

The idea of our final project is based on the theme of falconry, given that it is one of the most popular traditions in the UAE. We intend to have a moving backdrop depicting a desert at the back and in front of it would be falcon flying in the sky. We also intend to have a second falcon, which would dive in every hour (or some other time interval) from one of the corners of the box to catch a prey hopping (in the desert) in the opposite corner.

The mechanisms included in this project idea are as follows:

- A pulley mechanism for the moving backdrop
- A cam mechanism for the hopping preys
- A mechanism to keep the first falcon flying and flapping its wings: possibly a cam mechanism or a mechanism like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psu7wE6I680).
- A mechanism to make the second falcon dive in.
- A mechanism to make it appear as if the second falcon has caught a prey upon reaching closer to the herd of the preys: the pop-up mechanism that makes the prey appear from the behind the falcon at the right time to make it seem like the falcon caught the prey.

### Motors

We would need several motors and sensors to achieve the mentioned mechanisms. 

- DC motors:
    - for the flapping bird  
   
- Stepper motor
    - for the moving backdrop mechanism, 

- Servo motors: 
    - for the prey pop-up mechanism,
    - for the diving falcon mechanism
These mechanism work with servo motors better becuase we only need a movement of 180 degrees at max in these mechanisms.

### Sensors

We might also need sensors when we are using the DC motors, especially for the diving falcon mechanism. One of our ideas to make this mechanism is to use two DC motors with a fishing thread (because it is almost not visible to the viewers) with the bird attached to the thread. Then, one of the motors winds the thread while the other unwinds it to achieve the motion of the bird. In this mechanism we need the position sensors to know when to reverse the direction of movement of the bird (i.e., when to make the motors wind, unwind or stop).
