## Final Project Journal

### Week Apr 3

We finalized (almost) our idea for the final project and drew initial sketches for the mechanisms we decided to incorporate in our project.
The mechanisms include the following:

- A pulley mechanism for the moving backdrop
- A mechanism to keep the first falcon flying and flapping its wings: possibly a cam mechanism or a mechanism like this.
- A mechanism to make the second falcon dive in.
- A mechanism to make it appear as if the second falcon has caught a prey upon reaching closer to the herd of the preys: the pop-up mechanism that makes the prey appear from the behind the falcon at the right time to make it seem like the falcon caught the prey.

If we have time in the end, we may add the following mechanisms:

- A cam mechanism making the preys hop.
- A curtain mechanism to hide the resetting of the scene.

Diving Falcon and Prey Mechanism

### Week Apr 7

We made our first protoype for the flying falcon mechanism and we did measuring / figuried out how to layout all the mechanism in of our final project that proper fit within the box. 

The protoype was for the flying mechanism for the flacon which would move up and down in fornt of the screen while flapping it wings. The protoype was made from more cheaper materials so that we could make the mechanism faster and see what works and what does not.

Materials Used:

- Fishing Line
- Cardboard
- Small Metal Hooks 
- Wooden Stick

### What Did We Learn

The protoype did not work as we intended even though we followed majority of the steps for its recreations from online sources. We believe the problems lied in the material and size of the materials the protoype was created from. The size of the metal hooks compared to the size of the bird it too big and puts the wings too far apart from the body to allow the bobbing motion to take place. The cardboard it too light compared to wood. This prevented proper tension from taking place which in turn didnt allow the fishing line's flexibility to pull the bird up and down. Lastly the protoypes wings are not properly aligned and are not identical. This makes the weight unbalanced and makes the up and down movement not possible.

### Layout Within Box

We also used the box in the workshop to refine the layout for the final project.
