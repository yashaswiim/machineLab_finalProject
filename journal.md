## Final Project Journal

### Week Apr 3

We finalized (almost) our idea for the final project and drew initial sketches for the mechanisms we decided to incorporate in our project.
The mechanisms include the following:

- A pulley mechanism for the moving backdrop
- A mechanism to keep the first falcon flying and flapping its wings: possibly a cam mechanism or a mechanism like this.
- A mechanism to make the second falcon dive in.
- A mechanism to make it appear as if the second falcon has caught a prey upon reaching closer to the herd of the preys: the pop-up mechanism that makes the prey appear from the behind the falcon at the right time to make it seem like the falcon caught the prey.

If we have time in the end, we may add the following mechanisms:

- A cam mechanism making the preys hop.
- A curtain mechanism to hide the resetting of the scene.
